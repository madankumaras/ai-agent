The company's emphasis on learning and development stands out, providing access to numerous training programs and certifications that help enhance both technical and soft skills. The work culture is collaborative and inclusive, fostering teamwork and innovation.
TCS also offers immense opportunities for career growth with its global presence. The chance to work on diverse projects across various industries and technologies keeps the job exciting and challenging. Additionally, the company’s focus on work-life balance and employee well-being through flexible work policies and wellness initiatives is commendable.
The leadership is supportive, and feedback is valued, ensuring a positive workplace environment. The job security and stability that TCS provides are unparalleled, making it a reliable organization to build a long-term career.
Overall, TCS combines professional growth, personal development, and job satisfaction seamlessly....Read MoreSalary - Good Skill development - Good Job security - Excellent Work-life balance - Excellent DislikesWhile Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a respected organization with many positives, there are several aspects that need significant improvement to ensure a better employee experience.
One of the most concerning issues is the internal politics, particularly among senior management. It is often observed that individuals from South Indian backgrounds dominate leadership roles and tend to show favoritism towards others from similar regions. This creates a sense of bias and unfairness, which can be highly demotivating for employees from other regions. Merit and performance should always take precedence, but these practices sometimes overshadow the company’s otherwise professional environment. This regional bias restricts the diversity of thought and innovation that a global company like TCS should ideally promote.
Another major drawback is the prevalence of a close-minded approach among certain leaders and teams. Many in senior positions are resistant to change and prefer sticking to traditional processes, even when more efficient or innovative solutions are proposed. This rigidity hampers growth opportunities for employees who wish to bring fresh ideas to the table, making them feel undervalued and restricted. It also slows down the company’s ability to adapt to new market trends and technologies, which can have long-term implications.
The company’s 90-day notice period is another significant challenge. While it may be justified from a business continuity perspective, it poses considerable difficulties for employees seeking new opportunities. Many companies prefer candidates with shorter notice periods, and this extended timeframe can result in lost opportunities for growth outside of TCS. The rigid enforcement of this policy often leaves employees feeling trapped, especially if they are already disillusioned with other aspects of the job.
Compensation is another area where TCS falls short. The pay structure is often not competitive with industry standards, and increments are minimal despite years of service and consistent performance. For a company of TCS’s stature, employees expect better rewards for their efforts. Low pay, coupled with the high demands of client projects, often leads to dissatisfaction, especially when compared to peers in other organizations.
Promotions at TCS are another pain point. The process is slow and lacks transparency, making it difficult for employees to plan their career progression. Despite meeting performance expectations, many employees find themselves stuck in the same role for years, waiting for a long-overdue promotion. This delay not only affects morale but also makes it hard for employees to stay motivated and committed to the organization in the long term.
In conclusion, while TCS offers stability and learning opportunities, the issues of regional favoritism, resistance to change, long notice periods, low compensation, and delayed promotions overshadow the positives. Addressing these concerns would greatly improve the employee experience, foster a more inclusive and innovative workplace, and help TCS retain its talented workforce in an increasingly competitive industry....Read MorePromotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Poor Work DetailsWork days: Monday to Friday (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.11 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: The aesthetics of the company was good.

Company has a good relationship with its client whether it's domestic or international clients.Company culture - Good DislikesThe biggest weakness of TCS is the very elitist mindset with which it chooses to mistreat its employees with. There are several factors and incidents which influenced and led me to abscond this so called 'Prestigious' company within a month of joining. Let's discuss the factors with point by point. 
1. The good old office politics :Everything is related to one word 'Elitism'. Unfortunately during my time at TCS I was part of a team that simply did not care about my mental health, socio economic status and financial well being. Lack of proper sleep and constant bickering by my seniors led me to become an anxiety driven individual within a month of joining the company. Nearly all of the male seniors like trainers and team leaders ridiculed the my male colleagues and tried to touch or flirt inappropriately to my female colleagues which chose to maintan silence in worry of their jobs being lost from such a 'Prestigious' company. The female management was aware but chose to ignore as usual.
2. Ridiculous dressing policy : I have worked and interviewed several MNC in my life. Companies such as Accenture allow a semi formal attire in their workspace as long as it is not revealing and is appropriate. TCS being the elitist that it is made it a compulsion for me to wear the most mundane attire that anyone could wear and too from day 1. At the time my closet only had a handful of formal attires so I couldn't wear formal clothes on all working days because it took time for the clothes to turn up again from the wash cycle. Additionally I didn't had the means to go on a shopping spree of formal clothes for wearing at the company. The seniors as usual ignored all of this and chose to ridicule me in front of my colleagues. 
3. Hectic transportation : TCS is a billion dollar company and yet the Thane Hiranandani branch is located in the most remote place as possible. It is possible that the people in charge chose that location to save costs and rents. It was so farther away from thane station it took me 3 modes of publick transportation (2 busses and 1 rickshaw) to reach there. I spent every last of my penny just to travel to the work location. Second there were busses provided in the name of 'Transportation' for the employees. In order to reserve a seat in the busses one had to make a booking at the end of every month. The only catch was all of the seats got booked within seconds at the time of the booking. Which led me to discover that the whole system was rigged by a few people on the inside who charged employees 2000 bucks a month for reserving a seat on the bus. The very service that was provided for free. The quality of those busses was also laughable. The ironic thing is that while I waited for the bus from my location I used to notice busses from several other companies using Tata busses which were of good quality. TCS being a Tata company used third grade local busses which didn't had basic things such as shock absorber etc. The drivers were also not that equipped for driving. Within a month of traveling I witnessed a bus accident and also a separate incident where the driver was apprehended driving without a licence. 
In conclusion , the elitist nature and mindset of the people in charge at TCS let's them to freely exploit, mistreat and torture its employees. The Maharashtra government as usual chooses to ignore this and let's such companies continue running their racket. I am glad I absconded TCS and so should you.

No talented person would stay longer or join them. I was stupid who joined it but wise enough, who felt suffocated within 3 months.
Why?
Talent = Money, sorry! TCS doesn’t believe in that.
How can I say that?
1. They couldn’t afford more than 30% hike while onboarding me (believe me I wasn’t paid extravagantly in my previous organisation too)
2. Please check their median salaries offered to AI tech resources before joining.
On top of it, annual hikes in TCS are lesser than annual retail inflation (6.5-7%)
3. HR team (handling my case) lacked professionalism. In the first discussion, I told my salary expectations, the TCS recruiter agreed.
During last discussion (salary negotiations), the arrogant HR, sounded like a middleman, shouted on me for having unreasonable expectations (btw 50% was that I was expecting).
4. Aiming to take on American tech companies (who pay well to fuel the company’s growth), they have dead slow managers (who will retire from TCS only) sitting on low salaries and satisfied with zero learning will be your mentors.
Hence, before your mind junks and you become useless as most TCSians.

The company's emphasis on learning and development stands out, providing access to numerous training programs and certifications that help enhance both technical and soft skills. The work culture is collaborative and inclusive, fostering teamwork and innovation.
TCS also offers immense opportunities for career growth with its global presence. The chance to work on diverse projects across various industries and technologies keeps the job exciting and challenging. Additionally, the company’s focus on work-life balance and employee well-being through flexible work policies and wellness initiatives is commendable.
The leadership is supportive, and feedback is valued, ensuring a positive workplace environment. The job security and stability that TCS provides are unparalleled, making it a reliable organization to build a long-term career.
Overall, TCS combines professional growth, personal development, and job satisfaction seamlessly....Read MoreSalary - Good Skill development - Good Job security - Excellent Work-life balance - Excellent DislikesWhile Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a respected organization with many positives, there are several aspects that need significant improvement to ensure a better employee experience.
One of the most concerning issues is the internal politics, particularly among senior management. It is often observed that individuals from South Indian backgrounds dominate leadership roles and tend to show favoritism towards others from similar regions. This creates a sense of bias and unfairness, which can be highly demotivating for employees from other regions. Merit and performance should always take precedence, but these practices sometimes overshadow the company’s otherwise professional environment. This regional bias restricts the diversity of thought and innovation that a global company like TCS should ideally promote.
Another major drawback is the prevalence of a close-minded approach among certain leaders and teams. Many in senior positions are resistant to change and prefer sticking to traditional processes, even when more efficient or innovative solutions are proposed. This rigidity hampers growth opportunities for employees who wish to bring fresh ideas to the table, making them feel undervalued and restricted. It also slows down the company’s ability to adapt to new market trends and technologies, which can have long-term implications.
The company’s 90-day notice period is another significant challenge. While it may be justified from a business continuity perspective, it poses considerable difficulties for employees seeking new opportunities. Many companies prefer candidates with shorter notice periods, and this extended timeframe can result in lost opportunities for growth outside of TCS. The rigid enforcement of this policy often leaves employees feeling trapped, especially if they are already disillusioned with other aspects of the job.
Compensation is another area where TCS falls short. The pay structure is often not competitive with industry standards, and increments are minimal despite years of service and consistent performance. For a company of TCS’s stature, employees expect better rewards for their efforts. Low pay, coupled with the high demands of client projects, often leads to dissatisfaction, especially when compared to peers in other organizations.
Promotions at TCS are another pain point. The process is slow and lacks transparency, making it difficult for employees to plan their career progression. Despite meeting performance expectations, many employees find themselves stuck in the same role for years, waiting for a long-overdue promotion. This delay not only affects morale but also makes it hard for employees to stay motivated and committed to the organization in the long term.
In conclusion, while TCS offers stability and learning opportunities, the issues of regional favoritism, resistance to change, long notice periods, low compensation, and delayed promotions overshadow the positives. Addressing these concerns would greatly improve the employee experience, foster a more inclusive and innovative workplace, and help TCS retain its talented workforce in an increasingly competitive industry....Read MorePromotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Poor Work DetailsWork days: Monday to Friday (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.11 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: The aesthetics of the company was good.

Company has a good relationship with its client whether it's domestic or international clients.Company culture - Good DislikesThe biggest weakness of TCS is the very elitist mindset with which it chooses to mistreat its employees with. There are several factors and incidents which influenced and led me to abscond this so called 'Prestigious' company within a month of joining. Let's discuss the factors with point by point. 
1. The good old office politics :Everything is related to one word 'Elitism'. Unfortunately during my time at TCS I was part of a team that simply did not care about my mental health, socio economic status and financial well being. Lack of proper sleep and constant bickering by my seniors led me to become an anxiety driven individual within a month of joining the company. Nearly all of the male seniors like trainers and team leaders ridiculed the my male colleagues and tried to touch or flirt inappropriately to my female colleagues which chose to maintan silence in worry of their jobs being lost from such a 'Prestigious' company. The female management was aware but chose to ignore as usual.
2. Ridiculous dressing policy : I have worked and interviewed several MNC in my life. Companies such as Accenture allow a semi formal attire in their workspace as long as it is not revealing and is appropriate. TCS being the elitist that it is made it a compulsion for me to wear the most mundane attire that anyone could wear and too from day 1. At the time my closet only had a handful of formal attires so I couldn't wear formal clothes on all working days because it took time for the clothes to turn up again from the wash cycle. Additionally I didn't had the means to go on a shopping spree of formal clothes for wearing at the company. The seniors as usual ignored all of this and chose to ridicule me in front of my colleagues. 
3. Hectic transportation : TCS is a billion dollar company and yet the Thane Hiranandani branch is located in the most remote place as possible. It is possible that the people in charge chose that location to save costs and rents. It was so farther away from thane station it took me 3 modes of publick transportation (2 busses and 1 rickshaw) to reach there. I spent every last of my penny just to travel to the work location. Second there were busses provided in the name of 'Transportation' for the employees. In order to reserve a seat in the busses one had to make a booking at the end of every month. The only catch was all of the seats got booked within seconds at the time of the booking. Which led me to discover that the whole system was rigged by a few people on the inside who charged employees 2000 bucks a month for reserving a seat on the bus. The very service that was provided for free. The quality of those busses was also laughable. The ironic thing is that while I waited for the bus from my location I used to notice busses from several other companies using Tata busses which were of good quality. TCS being a Tata company used third grade local busses which didn't had basic things such as shock absorber etc. The drivers were also not that equipped for driving. Within a month of traveling I witnessed a bus accident and also a separate incident where the driver was apprehended driving without a licence. 
In conclusion , the elitist nature and mindset of the people in charge at TCS let's them to freely exploit, mistreat and torture its employees. The Maharashtra government as usual chooses to ignore this and let's such companies continue running their racket. I am glad I absconded TCS and so should you.

Similarity between a chain smoker and an employee in TCS, BOTH DIE A SLOW DEATH.
I can explain, read below.
No talented person would stay longer or join them. I was stupid who joined it but wise enough, who felt suffocated within 3 months.
Why?
Talent = Money, sorry! TCS doesn’t believe in that.
How can I say that?
1. They couldn’t afford more than 30% hike while onboarding me (believe me I wasn’t paid extravagantly in my previous organisation too)
2. Please check their median salaries offered to AI tech resources before joining.
On top of it, annual hikes in TCS are lesser than annual retail inflation (6.5-7%)
3. HR team (handling my case) lacked professionalism. In the first discussion, I told my salary expectations, the TCS recruiter agreed.
During last discussion (salary negotiations), the arrogant HR, sounded like a middleman, shouted on me for having unreasonable expectations (btw 50% was that I was expecting).
4. Aiming to take on American tech companies (who pay well to fuel the company’s growth), they have dead slow managers (who will retire from TCS only) sitting on low salaries and satisfied with zero learning will be your mentors.
Hence, before your mind junks and you become useless as most TCSians.

The company's emphasis on learning and development stands out, providing access to numerous training programs and certifications that help enhance both technical and soft skills. The work culture is collaborative and inclusive, fostering teamwork and innovation.
TCS also offers immense opportunities for career growth with its global presence. The chance to work on diverse projects across various industries and technologies keeps the job exciting and challenging. Additionally, the company’s focus on work-life balance and employee well-being through flexible work policies and wellness initiatives is commendable.
The leadership is supportive, and feedback is valued, ensuring a positive workplace environment. The job security and stability that TCS provides are unparalleled, making it a reliable organization to build a long-term career.
Overall, TCS combines professional growth, personal development, and job satisfaction seamlessly....Read MoreSalary - Good Skill development - Good Job security - Excellent Work-life balance - Excellent DislikesWhile Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a respected organization with many positives, there are several aspects that need significant improvement to ensure a better employee experience.
One of the most concerning issues is the internal politics, particularly among senior management. It is often observed that individuals from South Indian backgrounds dominate leadership roles and tend to show favoritism towards others from similar regions. This creates a sense of bias and unfairness, which can be highly demotivating for employees from other regions. Merit and performance should always take precedence, but these practices sometimes overshadow the company’s otherwise professional environment. This regional bias restricts the diversity of thought and innovation that a global company like TCS should ideally promote.
Another major drawback is the prevalence of a close-minded approach among certain leaders and teams. Many in senior positions are resistant to change and prefer sticking to traditional processes, even when more efficient or innovative solutions are proposed. This rigidity hampers growth opportunities for employees who wish to bring fresh ideas to the table, making them feel undervalued and restricted. It also slows down the company’s ability to adapt to new market trends and technologies, which can have long-term implications.
The company’s 90-day notice period is another significant challenge. While it may be justified from a business continuity perspective, it poses considerable difficulties for employees seeking new opportunities. Many companies prefer candidates with shorter notice periods, and this extended timeframe can result in lost opportunities for growth outside of TCS. The rigid enforcement of this policy often leaves employees feeling trapped, especially if they are already disillusioned with other aspects of the job.
Compensation is another area where TCS falls short. The pay structure is often not competitive with industry standards, and increments are minimal despite years of service and consistent performance. For a company of TCS’s stature, employees expect better rewards for their efforts. Low pay, coupled with the high demands of client projects, often leads to dissatisfaction, especially when compared to peers in other organizations.
Promotions at TCS are another pain point. The process is slow and lacks transparency, making it difficult for employees to plan their career progression. Despite meeting performance expectations, many employees find themselves stuck in the same role for years, waiting for a long-overdue promotion. This delay not only affects morale but also makes it hard for employees to stay motivated and committed to the organization in the long term.
In conclusion, while TCS offers stability and learning opportunities, the issues of regional favoritism, resistance to change, long notice periods, low compensation, and delayed promotions overshadow the positives. Addressing these concerns would greatly improve the employee experience, foster a more inclusive and innovative workplace, and help TCS retain its talented workforce in an increasingly competitive industry....Read MorePromotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Poor Work DetailsWork days: Monday to Friday (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.11 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: The aesthetics of the company was good.

Company has a good relationship with its client whether it's domestic or international clients.Company culture - Good DislikesThe biggest weakness of TCS is the very elitist mindset with which it chooses to mistreat its employees with. There are several factors and incidents which influenced and led me to abscond this so called 'Prestigious' company within a month of joining. Let's discuss the factors with point by point. 
1. The good old office politics :Everything is related to one word 'Elitism'. Unfortunately during my time at TCS I was part of a team that simply did not care about my mental health, socio economic status and financial well being. Lack of proper sleep and constant bickering by my seniors led me to become an anxiety driven individual within a month of joining the company. Nearly all of the male seniors like trainers and team leaders ridiculed the my male colleagues and tried to touch or flirt inappropriately to my female colleagues which chose to maintan silence in worry of their jobs being lost from such a 'Prestigious' company. The female management was aware but chose to ignore as usual.
2. Ridiculous dressing policy : I have worked and interviewed several MNC in my life. Companies such as Accenture allow a semi formal attire in their workspace as long as it is not revealing and is appropriate. TCS being the elitist that it is made it a compulsion for me to wear the most mundane attire that anyone could wear and too from day 1. At the time my closet only had a handful of formal attires so I couldn't wear formal clothes on all working days because it took time for the clothes to turn up again from the wash cycle. Additionally I didn't had the means to go on a shopping spree of formal clothes for wearing at the company. The seniors as usual ignored all of this and chose to ridicule me in front of my colleagues. 
3. Hectic transportation : TCS is a billion dollar company and yet the Thane Hiranandani branch is located in the most remote place as possible. It is possible that the people in charge chose that location to save costs and rents. It was so farther away from thane station it took me 3 modes of publick transportation (2 busses and 1 rickshaw) to reach there. I spent every last of my penny just to travel to the work location. Second there were busses provided in the name of 'Transportation' for the employees. In order to reserve a seat in the busses one had to make a booking at the end of every month. The only catch was all of the seats got booked within seconds at the time of the booking. Which led me to discover that the whole system was rigged by a few people on the inside who charged employees 2000 bucks a month for reserving a seat on the bus. The very service that was provided for free. The quality of those busses was also laughable. The ironic thing is that while I waited for the bus from my location I used to notice busses from several other companies using Tata busses which were of good quality. TCS being a Tata company used third grade local busses which didn't had basic things such as shock absorber etc. The drivers were also not that equipped for driving. Within a month of traveling I witnessed a bus accident and also a separate incident where the driver was apprehended driving without a licence. 
In conclusion , the elitist nature and mindset of the people in charge at TCS let's them to freely exploit, mistreat and torture its employees. The Maharashtra government as usual chooses to ignore this and let's such companies continue running their racket. I am glad I absconded TCS and so should you.

No talented person would stay longer or join them. I was stupid who joined it but wise enough, who felt suffocated within 3 months.
Why?
Talent = Money, sorry! TCS doesn’t believe in that.
How can I say that?
1. They couldn’t afford more than 30% hike while onboarding me (believe me I wasn’t paid extravagantly in my previous organisation too)
2. Please check their median salaries offered to AI tech resources before joining.
On top of it, annual hikes in TCS are lesser than annual retail inflation (6.5-7%)
3. HR team (handling my case) lacked professionalism. In the first discussion, I told my salary expectations, the TCS recruiter agreed.
During last discussion (salary negotiations), the arrogant HR, sounded like a middleman, shouted on me for having unreasonable expectations (btw 50% was that I was expecting).
4. Aiming to take on American tech companies (who pay well to fuel the company’s growth), they have dead slow managers (who will retire from TCS only) sitting on low salaries and satisfied with zero learning will be your mentors.
Hence, before your mind junks and you become useless as most TCSians.

The company's emphasis on learning and development stands out, providing access to numerous training programs and certifications that help enhance both technical and soft skills. The work culture is collaborative and inclusive, fostering teamwork and innovation.
TCS also offers immense opportunities for career growth with its global presence. The chance to work on diverse projects across various industries and technologies keeps the job exciting and challenging. Additionally, the company’s focus on work-life balance and employee well-being through flexible work policies and wellness initiatives is commendable.
The leadership is supportive, and feedback is valued, ensuring a positive workplace environment. The job security and stability that TCS provides are unparalleled, making it a reliable organization to build a long-term career.
Overall, TCS combines professional growth, personal development, and job satisfaction seamlessly....Read MoreSalary - Good Skill development - Good Job security - Excellent Work-life balance - Excellent DislikesWhile Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a respected organization with many positives, there are several aspects that need significant improvement to ensure a better employee experience.
One of the most concerning issues is the internal politics, particularly among senior management. It is often observed that individuals from South Indian backgrounds dominate leadership roles and tend to show favoritism towards others from similar regions. This creates a sense of bias and unfairness, which can be highly demotivating for employees from other regions. Merit and performance should always take precedence, but these practices sometimes overshadow the company’s otherwise professional environment. This regional bias restricts the diversity of thought and innovation that a global company like TCS should ideally promote.
Another major drawback is the prevalence of a close-minded approach among certain leaders and teams. Many in senior positions are resistant to change and prefer sticking to traditional processes, even when more efficient or innovative solutions are proposed. This rigidity hampers growth opportunities for employees who wish to bring fresh ideas to the table, making them feel undervalued and restricted. It also slows down the company’s ability to adapt to new market trends and technologies, which can have long-term implications.
The company’s 90-day notice period is another significant challenge. While it may be justified from a business continuity perspective, it poses considerable difficulties for employees seeking new opportunities. Many companies prefer candidates with shorter notice periods, and this extended timeframe can result in lost opportunities for growth outside of TCS. The rigid enforcement of this policy often leaves employees feeling trapped, especially if they are already disillusioned with other aspects of the job.
Compensation is another area where TCS falls short. The pay structure is often not competitive with industry standards, and increments are minimal despite years of service and consistent performance. For a company of TCS’s stature, employees expect better rewards for their efforts. Low pay, coupled with the high demands of client projects, often leads to dissatisfaction, especially when compared to peers in other organizations.
Promotions at TCS are another pain point. The process is slow and lacks transparency, making it difficult for employees to plan their career progression. Despite meeting performance expectations, many employees find themselves stuck in the same role for years, waiting for a long-overdue promotion. This delay not only affects morale but also makes it hard for employees to stay motivated and committed to the organization in the long term.
In conclusion, while TCS offers stability and learning opportunities, the issues of regional favoritism, resistance to change, long notice periods, low compensation, and delayed promotions overshadow the positives. Addressing these concerns would greatly improve the employee experience, foster a more inclusive and innovative workplace, and help TCS retain its talented workforce in an increasingly competitive industry....Read MorePromotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Poor Work DetailsWork days: Monday to Friday (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.11 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: The aesthetics of the company was good.

Company has a good relationship with its client whether it's domestic or international clients.Company culture - Good DislikesThe biggest weakness of TCS is the very elitist mindset with which it chooses to mistreat its employees with. There are several factors and incidents which influenced and led me to abscond this so called 'Prestigious' company within a month of joining. Let's discuss the factors with point by point. 
1. The good old office politics :Everything is related to one word 'Elitism'. Unfortunately during my time at TCS I was part of a team that simply did not care about my mental health, socio economic status and financial well being. Lack of proper sleep and constant bickering by my seniors led me to become an anxiety driven individual within a month of joining the company. Nearly all of the male seniors like trainers and team leaders ridiculed the my male colleagues and tried to touch or flirt inappropriately to my female colleagues which chose to maintan silence in worry of their jobs being lost from such a 'Prestigious' company. The female management was aware but chose to ignore as usual.
2. Ridiculous dressing policy : I have worked and interviewed several MNC in my life. Companies such as Accenture allow a semi formal attire in their workspace as long as it is not revealing and is appropriate. TCS being the elitist that it is made it a compulsion for me to wear the most mundane attire that anyone could wear and too from day 1. At the time my closet only had a handful of formal attires so I couldn't wear formal clothes on all working days because it took time for the clothes to turn up again from the wash cycle. Additionally I didn't had the means to go on a shopping spree of formal clothes for wearing at the company. The seniors as usual ignored all of this and chose to ridicule me in front of my colleagues. 
3. Hectic transportation : TCS is a billion dollar company and yet the Thane Hiranandani branch is located in the most remote place as possible. It is possible that the people in charge chose that location to save costs and rents. It was so farther away from thane station it took me 3 modes of publick transportation (2 busses and 1 rickshaw) to reach there. I spent every last of my penny just to travel to the work location. Second there were busses provided in the name of 'Transportation' for the employees. In order to reserve a seat in the busses one had to make a booking at the end of every month. The only catch was all of the seats got booked within seconds at the time of the booking. Which led me to discover that the whole system was rigged by a few people on the inside who charged employees 2000 bucks a month for reserving a seat on the bus. The very service that was provided for free. The quality of those busses was also laughable. The ironic thing is that while I waited for the bus from my location I used to notice busses from several other companies using Tata busses which were of good quality. TCS being a Tata company used third grade local busses which didn't had basic things such as shock absorber etc. The drivers were also not that equipped for driving. Within a month of traveling I witnessed a bus accident and also a separate incident where the driver was apprehended driving without a licence. 
In conclusion , the elitist nature and mindset of the people in charge at TCS let's them to freely exploit, mistreat and torture its employees. The Maharashtra government as usual chooses to ignore this and let's such companies continue running their racket. I am glad I absconded TCS and so should you.

Similarity between a chain smoker and an employee in TCS, BOTH DIE A SLOW DEATH.
I can explain, read below.
No talented person would stay longer or join them. I was stupid who joined it but wise enough, who felt suffocated within 3 months.
Why?
Talent = Money, sorry! TCS doesn’t believe in that.
How can I say that?
1. They couldn’t afford more than 30% hike while onboarding me (believe me I wasn’t paid extravagantly in my previous organisation too)
2. Please check their median salaries offered to AI tech resources before joining.
On top of it, annual hikes in TCS are lesser than annual retail inflation (6.5-7%)
3. HR team (handling my case) lacked professionalism. In the first discussion, I told my salary expectations, the TCS recruiter agreed.
During last discussion (salary negotiations), the arrogant HR, sounded like a middleman, shouted on me for having unreasonable expectations (btw 50% was that I was expecting).
4. Aiming to take on American tech companies (who pay well to fuel the company’s growth), they have dead slow managers (who will retire from TCS only) sitting on low salaries and satisfied with zero learning will be your mentors.
Hence, before your mind junks and you become useless as most TCSians.
