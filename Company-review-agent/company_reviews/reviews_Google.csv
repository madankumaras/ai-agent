These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.
  
2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences....Read MoreWork DetailsWork policy: 2 days/week from officeWork days: Monday to Saturday (Strict Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.4 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: Free Food and Commute Services Dislikes: 1) Dirty Polictics

4) L6 and L5 use their position power to put people on MI rating bcz they don't have anyone else.
5) If someone is on papers then they will threat you for giving regret hire or world is small place they will do this and that.
6) Once L6 and L7 deliver are done due to re-orgs and consistent team change a person career growth is always put on stake and not giving promotion.
7) Also u don't have free will to go in which team some time L5, L6 and L7 have connections so wont able to go top team you want to go.
8) Even managers dont allow you to go home they will intend that whole year you can do WFH for 21 working days otherwise put leaves.
9) Even at time of let say family demise people will like to chase you down asking to WFH in that critical situtation.
10) Here it is very highly depend on in which team you are in.

1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.
  
2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences....Read MoreWork DetailsWork policy: 2 days/week from officeWork days: Monday to Saturday (Strict Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.4 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: Free Food and Commute Services Dislikes: 1) Dirty Polictics

5) If someone is on papers then they will threat you for giving regret hire or world is small place they will do this and that.
6) Once L6 and L7 deliver are done due to re-orgs and consistent team change a person career growth is always put on stake and not giving promotion.
7) Also u don't have free will to go in which team some time L5, L6 and L7 have connections so wont able to go top team you want to go.
8) Even managers dont allow you to go home they will intend that whole year you can do WFH for 21 working days otherwise put leaves.

1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.
  
2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences....Read MoreWork DetailsWork policy: 2 days/week from officeWork days: Monday to Saturday (Strict Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.4 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: Free Food and Commute Services Dislikes: 1) Dirty Polictics

4) L6 and L5 use their position power to put people on MI rating bcz they don't have anyone else.
5) If someone is on papers then they will threat you for giving regret hire or world is small place they will do this and that.
6) Once L6 and L7 deliver are done due to re-orgs and consistent team change a person career growth is always put on stake and not giving promotion.
7) Also u don't have free will to go in which team some time L5, L6 and L7 have connections so wont able to go top team you want to go.
8) Even managers dont allow you to go home they will intend that whole year you can do WFH for 21 working days otherwise put leaves.
9) Even at time of let say family demise people will like to chase you down asking to WFH in that critical situtation.

The diversity of projects and the impact their work can have globally is another big draw for those who work there. Would you like to know more about specific aspects of Google's work cultureSalary - Excellent Skill development - Excellent Job security - Excellent Promotions - Excellent Work satisfaction - Excellent Company culture - Excellent Work-life balance - Excellent DislikesWhile many employees enjoy working at Google, some challenges have been reported by others. These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.
  
2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences....Read MoreWork DetailsWork policy: 2 days/week from officeWork days: Monday to Saturday (Strict Timings) Work related travel: This job involves Travel Within City.4 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: Free Food and Commute Services Dislikes: 1) Dirty Polictics

4) L6 and L5 use their position power to put people on MI rating bcz they don't have anyone else.
5) If someone is on papers then they will threat you for giving regret hire or world is small place they will do this and that.
6) Once L6 and L7 deliver are done due to re-orgs and consistent team change a person career growth is always put on stake and not giving promotion.
7) Also u don't have free will to go in which team some time L5, L6 and L7 have connections so wont able to go top team you want to go.
8) Even managers dont allow you to go home they will intend that whole year you can do WFH for 21 working days otherwise put leaves.
9) Even at time of let say family demise people will like to chase you down asking to WFH in that critical situtation.
