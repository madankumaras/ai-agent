Benefits like healthcare or retirement plans are sometimes seen as inadequate compared to competitors.Poor Management: Reviews frequently mention unprofessional or unsupportive management, with issues like favoritism, lack of clear communication, and micromanaging. Some employees describe middle management as toxic or incompetent, impacting work environment.Limited Career Growth: Career advancement is rated low (2.8/5 on AmbitionBox), with slow promotions, favoritism in opportunities, and challenges in project allocation that don’t always match skills.Work-Life Imbalance: High workloads, long hours, and mandatory overtime are common complaints, especially in customer-facing roles like call centers, leading to stress and burnout. Some report unrealistic KPIs and constant pressure.Inadequate Training and Support: Employees, particularly in customer support, criticize poor training processes that leave them unprepared for roles. Lack of feedback or guidance from management exacerbates this, especially for freshers.Job Insecurity and HR Issues: Concerns about job stability becouse if someone on bench then no project at bases location need to relocate if you are not ready then you will be fire any time,include sudden terminations, contract changes, or being sidelined when not billable. HR is often described as unresponsive or unhelpful, with issues like delayed salaries or incorrect payroll.Toxic Work Culture: Some reviews highlight a blame culture, favoritism, and lack of transparency.

1) No sick leave  ( everything is earned) you need to first finish all the given earned leaves then need to submit hospitalisation form in the portal HR needs to approves it then you will get the one day sick leave by that time you feel to die sick  rather than to apply.
2) Managers and other supervisors , absolute legends no idea what to do ,how to do anything post hiring time , couldnt get the basic outlook configuration done for an employee always running after new employees to finish training . The best part is training videos on the Tech M portal  ( i saw the same video for 4 times and  was unable to submit due to the worst server that they created . Managers without rectifying their issue will just come after us to finish the work irrespective of the time we invested in it ,Bizzare!!!
3) My laptop was provided by the client  it was a refurbished and os reimaged one . 
Always had an issue with hardware failure randome rebooting etc , on one fine day i was working the laptop went off wasnt turning on 
later contacted the client IT they said to visit the office , they said will report back to me next day . After  couple of days they informed motherboard  is damaged and warranty cant be claimed because of liquid fill . and yes to be honest ,  they sent a mail with photo with Ic damaged with water spill . But the question is why should someone pour water on the laptop deliberately ? . ok then they sent me the quotation of 12k to pay and Tech mahindra magicians without any concern asked me to pay the whole amount . this is the value that they give to the employees.
4) Salary is the best part  never received my CTC salary or net pay in my account always 4000 to 5000 -/- less . if you ask anything to the manager they will ask to create a ticket and the end result they wont call or message on teams just close the ticket without informing .
5) Folks please dont work for 3 or 4 lpa provided by these indian service based companies , yes i can understand the financial condition and employment rate but please dont waste your talent in such organisation either u feel mentally stressed out or will get into comfort zone by just being their pupet...Read MoreSalary - Bad Skill development - Bad Job security - Bad Promotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Bad Work-life balance - Bad Work DetailsWork days: Rotational Shift (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This is a desk job.4 UpvoteCommentShareView all detailed Tech Mahindra employee reviewsJobseekers also viewedTCS Reviews3.6 • 98.3k  reviewsAccenture Reviews3.8 • 63.3k  reviewsWipro Reviews3.7 • 57.3k  reviewsCognizant Reviews3.7 • 54.5k  reviewsCapgemini Reviews3.7 • 46.1k  reviewsInfosys Reviews3.6 • 42.9k  reviewsHCLTech Reviews3.5 • 39.6k  reviewsGenpact Reviews3.8 • 35.8k  reviewsIBM Reviews4.0 • 23.5k  reviewsLTIMindtree Reviews3.7 • 22.7k  reviewsDXC Technology Reviews3.7 • 10.8k  reviewsMphasis Reviews3.3 • 9.1k  reviewsHCL Group Reviews3.6 • 5.8k  reviewsL&T Technology Services Reviews3.3 • 5.6k  reviewsCoforge Reviews3.3 • 5.5k  reviewseClerx Reviews3.2 • 5.4k  reviewsCyient Reviews3.7 • 4.9k  reviewsPersistent Systems Reviews3.6 • 4.4k  reviewsNTT Data Reviews3.8 • 4.3k  reviewsBirlasoft Reviews3.6 • 3.2k  reviewsExplore Reviews by DepartmentView AllEngineering - Software & QA3.6 • 10.3k  reviewsCustomer Success, Service & Operations3.4 • 8.7k  reviewsIT & Information Security3.6 • 2k  reviewsEngineering - Hardware & Networks3.6 • 1.5k  reviewsData Science & Analytics3.5 • 1k  reviewsBFSI, Investments & Trading3.6 • 948  reviewsProject & Program Management3.5 • 898  reviewsHuman Resources3.5 • 755  reviewsConsulting3.6 • 707  reviewsFinance & Accounting3.6 • 703  reviewsSales & Business Development3.3 • 554  reviewsResearch & Development3.2 • 529  reviewsProduction, Manufacturing & Engineering3.4 • 522  reviewsQuality Assurance3.6 • 406  reviewsTeaching & Training3.6 • 275  reviewsAdministration & Facilities3.8 • 187  reviewsMarketing & Communication3.4 • 187  reviewsHealthcare & Life Sciences3.4 • 173  reviewsProcurement & Supply Chain3.6 • 133  reviewsUX, Design & Architecture3.7 • 131  reviewsContent, Editorial & Journalism3.4 • 97  reviewsProduct Management3.5 • 87  reviewsCSR & Social Service3.3 • 69  reviewsMerchandising, Retail & eCommerce3.4 • 59  reviewsConstruction & Site Engineering4.0 • 53  reviewsStrategic & Top Management3.1 • 52  reviewsAviation & Aerospace3.3 • 49  reviewsRisk Management & Compliance3.6 • 49  reviewsMedia Production & Entertainment3.3 • 48  reviewsFood, Beverage & Hospitality3.2 • 39  reviewsLegal & Regulatory2.9 • 36  reviewsEnergy & Mining3.3 • 29  reviewsSecurity Services4.3 • 9  reviewsSports, Fitness & Personal Care4.1 • 9  reviewsShipping & Maritime4.6 • 7  reviewsTop Mentions in Tech Mahindra  ReviewsSalary (5786)Senior Management (3777)Work Life Balance (3362)Work Culture (3181)Appraisal (2943)Work Environment (2881)+ 4 more38.1k reviews foundSort By: PopularLikes: The only good thing was the account I was working on.

Benefits like healthcare or retirement plans are sometimes seen as inadequate compared to competitors.Poor Management: Reviews frequently mention unprofessional or unsupportive management, with issues like favoritism, lack of clear communication, and micromanaging. Some employees describe middle management as toxic or incompetent, impacting work environment.Limited Career Growth: Career advancement is rated low (2.8/5 on AmbitionBox), with slow promotions, favoritism in opportunities, and challenges in project allocation that don’t always match skills.Work-Life Imbalance: High workloads, long hours, and mandatory overtime are common complaints, especially in customer-facing roles like call centers, leading to stress and burnout. Some report unrealistic KPIs and constant pressure.Inadequate Training and Support: Employees, particularly in customer support, criticize poor training processes that leave them unprepared for roles. Lack of feedback or guidance from management exacerbates this, especially for freshers.Job Insecurity and HR Issues: Concerns about job stability becouse if someone on bench then no project at bases location need to relocate if you are not ready then you will be fire any time,include sudden terminations, contract changes, or being sidelined when not billable. HR is often described as unresponsive or unhelpful, with issues like delayed salaries or incorrect payroll.Toxic Work Culture: Some reviews highlight a blame culture, favoritism, and lack of transparency. Serious allegations, like unaddressed harassment or unprofessional behavior, appear in isolated but concerning reviews on Trustpilot.Outdated Technology: A few employees note working with older tech stacks, which can hinder skill development compared to industry peers....Read MoreWork DetailsWork policy: 3 days/week from officeWork days: Monday to Friday (Strict Timings) Work related travel: This is a desk job.4 UpvoteCommentShareLikes: Yes the client project is good , very organised but Tech M is just pathetic.

1) No sick leave  ( everything is earned) you need to first finish all the given earned leaves then need to submit hospitalisation form in the portal HR needs to approves it then you will get the one day sick leave by that time you feel to die sick  rather than to apply.
2) Managers and other supervisors , absolute legends no idea what to do ,how to do anything post hiring time , couldnt get the basic outlook configuration done for an employee always running after new employees to finish training . The best part is training videos on the Tech M portal  ( i saw the same video for 4 times and  was unable to submit due to the worst server that they created . Managers without rectifying their issue will just come after us to finish the work irrespective of the time we invested in it ,Bizzare!!!
3) My laptop was provided by the client  it was a refurbished and os reimaged one . 
Always had an issue with hardware failure randome rebooting etc , on one fine day i was working the laptop went off wasnt turning on 
later contacted the client IT they said to visit the office , they said will report back to me next day . After  couple of days they informed motherboard  is damaged and warranty cant be claimed because of liquid fill . and yes to be honest ,  they sent a mail with photo with Ic damaged with water spill . But the question is why should someone pour water on the laptop deliberately ? . ok then they sent me the quotation of 12k to pay and Tech mahindra magicians without any concern asked me to pay the whole amount . this is the value that they give to the employees.
4) Salary is the best part  never received my CTC salary or net pay in my account always 4000 to 5000 -/- less . if you ask anything to the manager they will ask to create a ticket and the end result they wont call or message on teams just close the ticket without informing .
5) Folks please dont work for 3 or 4 lpa provided by these indian service based companies , yes i can understand the financial condition and employment rate but please dont waste your talent in such organisation either u feel mentally stressed out or will get into comfort zone by just being their pupet...Read MoreSalary - Bad Skill development - Bad Job security - Bad Promotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Bad Work-life balance - Bad Work DetailsWork days: Rotational Shift (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This is a desk job.4 UpvoteCommentShareView all detailed Tech Mahindra employee reviewsJobseekers also viewedTCS Reviews3.6 • 98.3k  reviewsAccenture Reviews3.8 • 63.3k  reviewsWipro Reviews3.7 • 57.3k  reviewsCognizant Reviews3.7 • 54.5k  reviewsCapgemini Reviews3.7 • 46.1k  reviewsInfosys Reviews3.6 • 42.9k  reviewsHCLTech Reviews3.5 • 39.6k  reviewsGenpact Reviews3.8 • 35.8k  reviewsIBM Reviews4.0 • 23.5k  reviewsLTIMindtree Reviews3.7 • 22.7k  reviewsDXC Technology Reviews3.7 • 10.8k  reviewsMphasis Reviews3.3 • 9.1k  reviewsHCL Group Reviews3.6 • 5.8k  reviewsL&T Technology Services Reviews3.3 • 5.6k  reviewsCoforge Reviews3.3 • 5.5k  reviewseClerx Reviews3.2 • 5.4k  reviewsCyient Reviews3.7 • 4.9k  reviewsPersistent Systems Reviews3.6 • 4.4k  reviewsNTT Data Reviews3.8 • 4.3k  reviewsBirlasoft Reviews3.6 • 3.2k  reviewsExplore Reviews by DepartmentView AllEngineering - Software & QA3.6 • 10.3k  reviewsCustomer Success, Service & Operations3.4 • 8.7k  reviewsIT & Information Security3.6 • 2k  reviewsEngineering - Hardware & Networks3.6 • 1.5k  reviewsData Science & Analytics3.5 • 1k  reviewsBFSI, Investments & Trading3.6 • 948  reviewsProject & Program Management3.5 • 898  reviewsHuman Resources3.5 • 755  reviewsConsulting3.6 • 707  reviewsFinance & Accounting3.6 • 703  reviewsSales & Business Development3.3 • 554  reviewsResearch & Development3.2 • 529  reviewsProduction, Manufacturing & Engineering3.4 • 522  reviewsQuality Assurance3.6 • 406  reviewsTeaching & Training3.6 • 275  reviewsAdministration & Facilities3.8 • 187  reviewsMarketing & Communication3.4 • 187  reviewsHealthcare & Life Sciences3.4 • 173  reviewsProcurement & Supply Chain3.6 • 133  reviewsUX, Design & Architecture3.7 • 131  reviewsContent, Editorial & Journalism3.4 • 97  reviewsProduct Management3.5 • 87  reviewsCSR & Social Service3.3 • 69  reviewsMerchandising, Retail & eCommerce3.4 • 59  reviewsConstruction & Site Engineering4.0 • 53  reviewsStrategic & Top Management3.1 • 52  reviewsAviation & Aerospace3.3 • 49  reviewsRisk Management & Compliance3.6 • 49  reviewsMedia Production & Entertainment3.3 • 48  reviewsFood, Beverage & Hospitality3.2 • 39  reviewsLegal & Regulatory2.9 • 36  reviewsEnergy & Mining3.3 • 29  reviewsSecurity Services4.3 • 9  reviewsSports, Fitness & Personal Care4.1 • 9  reviewsShipping & Maritime4.6 • 7  reviewsTop Mentions in Tech Mahindra  ReviewsSalary (5786)Senior Management (3777)Work Life Balance (3362)Work Culture (3181)Appraisal (2943)Work Environment (2881)+ 4 more38.1k reviews foundSort By: PopularLikes: The only good thing was the account I was working on.

Some employees describe middle management as toxic or incompetent, impacting work environment.Limited Career Growth: Career advancement is rated low (2.8/5 on AmbitionBox), with slow promotions, favoritism in opportunities, and challenges in project allocation that don’t always match skills.Work-Life Imbalance: High workloads, long hours, and mandatory overtime are common complaints, especially in customer-facing roles like call centers, leading to stress and burnout. Some report unrealistic KPIs and constant pressure.Inadequate Training and Support: Employees, particularly in customer support, criticize poor training processes that leave them unprepared for roles. Lack of feedback or guidance from management exacerbates this, especially for freshers.Job Insecurity and HR Issues: Concerns about job stability becouse if someone on bench then no project at bases location need to relocate if you are not ready then you will be fire any time,include sudden terminations, contract changes, or being sidelined when not billable.

1) No sick leave  ( everything is earned) you need to first finish all the given earned leaves then need to submit hospitalisation form in the portal HR needs to approves it then you will get the one day sick leave by that time you feel to die sick  rather than to apply.
2) Managers and other supervisors , absolute legends no idea what to do ,how to do anything post hiring time , couldnt get the basic outlook configuration done for an employee always running after new employees to finish training . The best part is training videos on the Tech M portal  ( i saw the same video for 4 times and  was unable to submit due to the worst server that they created . Managers without rectifying their issue will just come after us to finish the work irrespective of the time we invested in it ,Bizzare!!!
3) My laptop was provided by the client  it was a refurbished and os reimaged one . 
Always had an issue with hardware failure randome rebooting etc , on one fine day i was working the laptop went off wasnt turning on 
later contacted the client IT they said to visit the office , they said will report back to me next day . After  couple of days they informed motherboard  is damaged and warranty cant be claimed because of liquid fill . and yes to be honest ,  they sent a mail with photo with Ic damaged with water spill . But the question is why should someone pour water on the laptop deliberately ? . ok then they sent me the quotation of 12k to pay and Tech mahindra magicians without any concern asked me to pay the whole amount . this is the value that they give to the employees.
4) Salary is the best part  never received my CTC salary or net pay in my account always 4000 to 5000 -/- less . if you ask anything to the manager they will ask to create a ticket and the end result they wont call or message on teams just close the ticket without informing .

Benefits like healthcare or retirement plans are sometimes seen as inadequate compared to competitors.Poor Management: Reviews frequently mention unprofessional or unsupportive management, with issues like favoritism, lack of clear communication, and micromanaging. Some employees describe middle management as toxic or incompetent, impacting work environment.Limited Career Growth: Career advancement is rated low (2.8/5 on AmbitionBox), with slow promotions, favoritism in opportunities, and challenges in project allocation that don’t always match skills.Work-Life Imbalance: High workloads, long hours, and mandatory overtime are common complaints, especially in customer-facing roles like call centers, leading to stress and burnout. Some report unrealistic KPIs and constant pressure.Inadequate Training and Support: Employees, particularly in customer support, criticize poor training processes that leave them unprepared for roles. Lack of feedback or guidance from management exacerbates this, especially for freshers.Job Insecurity and HR Issues: Concerns about job stability becouse if someone on bench then no project at bases location need to relocate if you are not ready then you will be fire any time,include sudden terminations, contract changes, or being sidelined when not billable. HR is often described as unresponsive or unhelpful, with issues like delayed salaries or incorrect payroll.Toxic Work Culture: Some reviews highlight a blame culture, favoritism, and lack of transparency.

1) No sick leave  ( everything is earned) you need to first finish all the given earned leaves then need to submit hospitalisation form in the portal HR needs to approves it then you will get the one day sick leave by that time you feel to die sick  rather than to apply.
2) Managers and other supervisors , absolute legends no idea what to do ,how to do anything post hiring time , couldnt get the basic outlook configuration done for an employee always running after new employees to finish training . The best part is training videos on the Tech M portal  ( i saw the same video for 4 times and  was unable to submit due to the worst server that they created . Managers without rectifying their issue will just come after us to finish the work irrespective of the time we invested in it ,Bizzare!!!
3) My laptop was provided by the client  it was a refurbished and os reimaged one . 
Always had an issue with hardware failure randome rebooting etc , on one fine day i was working the laptop went off wasnt turning on 
later contacted the client IT they said to visit the office , they said will report back to me next day . After  couple of days they informed motherboard  is damaged and warranty cant be claimed because of liquid fill . and yes to be honest ,  they sent a mail with photo with Ic damaged with water spill . But the question is why should someone pour water on the laptop deliberately ? . ok then they sent me the quotation of 12k to pay and Tech mahindra magicians without any concern asked me to pay the whole amount . this is the value that they give to the employees.
4) Salary is the best part  never received my CTC salary or net pay in my account always 4000 to 5000 -/- less . if you ask anything to the manager they will ask to create a ticket and the end result they wont call or message on teams just close the ticket without informing .
5) Folks please dont work for 3 or 4 lpa provided by these indian service based companies , yes i can understand the financial condition and employment rate but please dont waste your talent in such organisation either u feel mentally stressed out or will get into comfort zone by just being their pupet...Read MoreSalary - Bad Skill development - Bad Job security - Bad Promotions - Bad Work satisfaction - Bad Company culture - Bad Work-life balance - Bad Work DetailsWork days: Rotational Shift (Flexible Timings) Work related travel: This is a desk job.4 UpvoteCommentShareView all detailed Tech Mahindra employee reviewsJobseekers also viewedTCS Reviews3.6 • 98.3k  reviewsAccenture Reviews3.8 • 63.3k  reviewsWipro Reviews3.7 • 57.3k  reviewsCognizant Reviews3.7 • 54.5k  reviewsCapgemini Reviews3.7 • 46.1k  reviewsInfosys Reviews3.6 • 42.9k  reviewsHCLTech Reviews3.5 • 39.6k  reviewsGenpact Reviews3.8 • 35.8k  reviewsIBM Reviews4.0 • 23.5k  reviewsLTIMindtree Reviews3.7 • 22.7k  reviewsDXC Technology Reviews3.7 • 10.8k  reviewsMphasis Reviews3.3 • 9.1k  reviewsHCL Group Reviews3.6 • 5.8k  reviewsL&T Technology Services Reviews3.3 • 5.6k  reviewsCoforge Reviews3.3 • 5.5k  reviewseClerx Reviews3.2 • 5.4k  reviewsCyient Reviews3.7 • 4.9k  reviewsPersistent Systems Reviews3.6 • 4.4k  reviewsNTT Data Reviews3.8 • 4.3k  reviewsBirlasoft Reviews3.6 • 3.2k  reviewsExplore Reviews by DepartmentView AllEngineering - Software & QA3.6 • 10.3k  reviewsCustomer Success, Service & Operations3.4 • 8.7k  reviewsIT & Information Security3.6 • 2k  reviewsEngineering - Hardware & Networks3.6 • 1.5k  reviewsData Science & Analytics3.5 • 1k  reviewsBFSI, Investments & Trading3.6 • 948  reviewsProject & Program Management3.5 • 898  reviewsHuman Resources3.5 • 755  reviewsConsulting3.6 • 707  reviewsFinance & Accounting3.6 • 703  reviewsSales & Business Development3.3 • 554  reviewsResearch & Development3.2 • 529  reviewsProduction, Manufacturing & Engineering3.4 • 522  reviewsQuality Assurance3.6 • 406  reviewsTeaching & Training3.6 • 275  reviewsAdministration & Facilities3.8 • 187  reviewsMarketing & Communication3.4 • 187  reviewsHealthcare & Life Sciences3.4 • 173  reviewsProcurement & Supply Chain3.6 • 133  reviewsUX, Design & Architecture3.7 • 131  reviewsContent, Editorial & Journalism3.4 • 97  reviewsProduct Management3.5 • 87  reviewsCSR & Social Service3.3 • 69  reviewsMerchandising, Retail & eCommerce3.4 • 59  reviewsConstruction & Site Engineering4.0 • 53  reviewsStrategic & Top Management3.1 • 52  reviewsAviation & Aerospace3.3 • 49  reviewsRisk Management & Compliance3.6 • 49  reviewsMedia Production & Entertainment3.3 • 48  reviewsFood, Beverage & Hospitality3.2 • 39  reviewsLegal & Regulatory2.9 • 36  reviewsEnergy & Mining3.3 • 29  reviewsSecurity Services4.3 • 9  reviewsSports, Fitness & Personal Care4.1 • 9  reviewsShipping & Maritime4.6 • 7  reviewsTop Mentions in Tech Mahindra  ReviewsSalary (5786)Senior Management (3777)Work Life Balance (3362)Work Culture (3181)Appraisal (2943)Work Environment (2881)+ 4 more38.1k reviews foundSort By: PopularLikes: The only good thing was the account I was working on.
